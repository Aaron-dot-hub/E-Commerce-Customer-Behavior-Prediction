## E-commerce Customer Behavior Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict customer behavior in an e-commerce setting using machine learning techniques. The goal is to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering and predict user engagement patterns with XGBoost. The final model is integrated into a Streamlit-based web application for easy interaction and visualization.

## 🚀 Features
- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Identifying key factors influencing customer engagement.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Using XGBoost to forecast customer actions.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A Streamlit-based UI for real-time analytics and visualization.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Hosting the application for seamless access.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related attributes such as:
- **Customer Demographics:** Age, Gender, Location
- **Transaction Data:** Transaction ID, Purchase Date, Items Purchased, Purchase Frequency, Monetary Value
- **User Engagement:** Browsing Duration, Pages Visited, Cart Abandonment, Last Login Date, Email Click Rate
- **Product Interactions:** Product ID, Product Category, Discounts Used
- **Behavioral Indicators:** Churn Indicator, Referral Source, Average Session Duration, Preferred Device

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud / Heroku
